The project is a game based on popular website 'wordle'.
The goal is to guess the correct word based on clues,
that are given after guessing each word. User can guess up 
to 15 words unstill he runs out of chances. Each turn user will
be informed about the location of the word in the alphabet. For examle,
if user guesses word 'Abuse', and the word he is looking for is 'Entry', 
he will be informed that the word is further in the alphabet. User has also
knowledge about letters in correct order. For example if he guesses 'Frame', and
the word given is 'Fruit', he will receive information that letters 'F' and 'r' are
in correct order.
